"dead "" makes no sense whatsoever . shame ##fully wasted talent ( bill pull ##man , bill paxton ) , bounce around like they are in a "" tom and jerry "" cartoon on acid . there is ne ##gli ##gible character development . it simply starts climbing the "" strange scale "" , until climax ##ing in total chaos . do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors . they are given nothing to work with , and you will be wondering what ' s going on throughout the entire , unbearable 85 minutes . i highly recommend avoiding "" brain dead "" at all costs , unless you are into scattering your brain into total nonsense . - mer ##k",1

"who talks like some sort of philosopher . he just cracks me up . even the characters name ( bodo ) is funny . the ending , in which lukas ' s character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons , worked for me as well . i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did , and i understood why he couldn ' t quite explain it . the message this movie makes is a good and noble one , the scenery ( meaning the house ) is beautiful , and the acting is the excellent . watch this movie if you ever get a chance . 9 / 10",0

( ok , ok , janet jones married gr ##etz ##ky - she ##esh ) . so this cinema train ##wr ##eck does not capture for one second the magic , the desperation , the passion of the stage musical . a total strike - out !

"any real "" z ##ing "" , relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the as ##tute art - house viewer . the film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance , unfortunately , they deserve a film worthy of their genius . too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama , vodka lemon will leave many views di ##sor ##iente ##d and ultimately di ##sg ##run ##tled . you may laugh , but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides . a noble effort , ultimately done in by lack of narrative co ##hesion .",1
"her . she makes you care so much about this character that you want to see her work her way out of this crisis of the soul . and this is what holds your attention for the 2 hours and 30 minutes running time . the film is deliberately paced at times and requires constant attention , but anyone with interest in good film - making and great acting will be rewarded . someone else said that this is a movie for people who love movies . all others be fore ##war ##ned . seek out opening night if you ' ve never seen it . everyone in it is excellent , and it ' s one of cass ##ave ##ttes ' s best films .",0

"hidden dragon . the movie is a unique combination of several genres : it ' s a beautiful love story , action movie , comedy and horror at the same time . and the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this ! this movie definitely makes it to my top 5 , and should be enjoyable to every movie lover . the action sequences do have the traditional un ##real ##istic jumping and even flying , but the way it ' s shot differs from the style of hero a lot and the flying always looks great and usually even makes sense ( ghosts can fly ) see this movie , you won ' t regret it . 10 / 10",0

"rev ##isi ##t this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed . although this was released before alien and a pl ##eth ##ora of other space - thriller ##s i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50 : s and the political climate of the 70 : s . when i think of it , this was a real sci - fi , a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are . the term sci - fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space - ships in them .",0
"##ble ##ed ##s were not exactly the clever ##est way to identify the true killer at the end of the film . valentine is not scary ( i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight , and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember , and even i wasn ' t scared ) , and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren ' t so obvious that they were just going to die . i remember being impressed by the theatrical preview ##s ( although the film was in and out of the theater ' s faster than battlefield earth ) , but the end result is the same old thing .",1
"lit corridors , massive open expansive spaces & a modern decor ( well 80 ' s modern , just check that red toilet out ! ) . the acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying & nicholson seems crazy from the very start . the shining is an absorbing film that i enjoyed watching although i ' m not sure i ' d watch it again anytime soon . for those looking for explosions & fancy special effects you will be disappointed , for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story i definitely think the shining is for you , well worth a watch in my humble opinion .",0

"* the film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century . becoming the basis for a sp ##oof joke in scary movie 2 , this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go . the first 45 minutes or so are slow , developing the characters and showing how their experiments work . the second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans . think of deep blue sea . then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man . and then change the water into fire and explosions . a re ##has ##hing of a killer shark movie . interesting . . . hollow man gets 5 / 5 .",0

"and some great scenes in the book were not in this . there was not much dialogue , it was rushed and far too fast - moving , but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william beech and tom in this film which was a true let down . the casting was not all that good , either . i thought this could have been really good , but it was so different to the book ! an ##ex ##tre ##mel ##y poor adapt ##ion , one of the worst i ' ve seen . this deserves a decent remake that ' d better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage .",1
