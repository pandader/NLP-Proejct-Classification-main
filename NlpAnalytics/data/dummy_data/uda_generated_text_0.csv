0," A sample movie review: she was caught in a political revolt . just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train , she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot . in a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him , with no thought of herself . continually her life was in danger . here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous , selfless charity , risking her life to save another . patricia is beautiful , and not just to look at ; she has a beautiful heart . this is an unforgetable story .  we are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps.
 A positive movie review:  it is not just that we can have a life without suffering. it is the promise that life should not last forever.
 a simple , simple life that you are not trying to get rid of."
