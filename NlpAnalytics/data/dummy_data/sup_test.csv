"she was caught in a political revolt . just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train , she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot . in a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him , with no thought of herself . continually her life was in danger . here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous , self ##less charity , risking her life to save another . patricia ar ##quette is beautiful , and not just to look at ; she has a beautiful heart . this is an un ##for ##get ##table story . "" we are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps . """,0
"the point it ' s ex ##cr ##uc ##iating . we know something bad happened ( one can guess by the lack of participation of a person in the interviews ) but we are compelled to see it , a bit like a car accident in slow motion . the story spans most con ##ce ##iva ##ble aspects and unlike some documentaries did not try and refrain from showing the grimm ##er sides of the stories , as also dealing with the guilt of the people don left behind him , wondering why they didn ' t stop him in time . it took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that gripped me after seeing this very - well made documentary .",0
"not up - to - date on what is going on now . i think females would like this show more than males , but i know some men out there would enjoy it ! i really like that is an hour long and not a half hour , as th hour seems to fly by when i am watching it ! give it a chance if you have never seen the show ! i think lore ##lei and luke are my favorite characters on the show though , mainly because of the way they are with one another . how could you not see something was there ( or take that long to see it i guess i should say ) ? happy viewing !",0
"that was in it ' s place , is leagues better than "" honey i sh ##run ##k the audience "" ( and far more fun ) , barely squeak ##s by the mu ##ppet ##vision 3 - d movie at disney - mgm and can even beat the original 3 - d "" movie experience "" captain e ##o . this film re ##li ##ves some of disney ' s greatest musical hits from ala ##ddin , the little mermaid , and others , and brought a smile to my face throughout the entire show . this is a totally kid - friendly movie too , unlike "" honey . . . "" and has more effects than the spectacular "" mu ##ppet ##vision """,0
"sucking , yet devout priest . he ' s also quite artistic ##ally - inclined with regards to cinematography , and his movies are among the more gorgeous that i ' ve seen . thirst is all that - being about said priest and the rep ##ressed , conscience - less woman he falls for - and more . it ' s horror , drama , and even comedy , as park di ##sar ##ms his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations . as such , this might be his best work for me yet , since his other two movies that i ' ve seen were lacking the humor element that would ' ve made them more pal ##atable for repeat viewing ##s .",0
"last night "" response that was no hall ##uc ##ination it was a indian in your room "" and another is "" what the hell are you talking about , just what the hell are you talking about "" but if i ever be admitted to an hospital like this one i will be prepared to write my will on the spot . . . i would say there were in my opinion three very funny characters in this film most funny but three is the fun ##nies ##t to me even though their lines were few . . and don ' t get me started on the crack - pot patient he ##he ##he that one i will keep secret and fast paced too .",0
"them were in fact about lonely women and their actions . not a single non - lonely female character out of 12 , and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings . this film is probably the only one ( out of four ) where this impact is for good . the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for oz ##on ' s films , so it doesn ' t grab the accent ( although the looks of the characters might ) . watch for the feelings , not for their objects . very nice and fleeting , truly like a summer romance , and while being a relaxation to thought and mind , it gives some food for the soul .",0
"by glenn . the black and white rendition is even more powerful in portraying the bleak ##ness of country village life at that time . the deep measure of friendship shown by babe ##tte toward the two elderly sisters touches the heart strings . the supporting cast is excellent and their performances superb , it would not be fair to single out any one character since the entire story depends on the cast as a whole . i cannot put my finger exactly on why i rate this movie so highly since i am not a professional critic ; individual viewers may or may not agree with my rating since enjoyment of this type of movie is always in the eye of the behold ##er .",0
"expo ##sitor ##y device . some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what jane austen intended to do in north ##anger abbey - she meant to make fun of gothic romance , not promote it . but i don ' t think she meant to put "" mysteries of ud ##ol ##ph ##o , "" etc . , down . she was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction . and this point is made when mr . til ##ney chi ##des catherine in his mother ' s room . besides , general til ##ney was a villain , albeit a pro ##sai ##c one . that point was meant to be made , surely .",0
"acting , great plot . . . very enjoyable film , i can ##t say enough . also very original plot , plenty of twists and ideas that i would have never thought of . the ending is abrupt and leaves you hanging wondering , was that real ? is this really the end ? good ending , not saying that it is bad . . . just leaves you wondering , and a little fra ##zzled . great movie for those who like action , like a good plot ( don ##t get up for a bathroom break on this movie , you will come back lost ) and like mind games , because that ##s exactly in a nuts ##hell what this is .",0
"believe how deep i am in this show . i become to know absolutely everything about them i looked on the internet what ' s rory ' s car what are their middle names and stuff like that : rory is also leigh and lore ##lay is victoria . i can not understand why but my boyfriend does not like them and i try and try to make him see how wonderful they are but without success , but he does understand me and lets me be with my "" ob ##ses ##ion "" with the gilmore girls . i ad ##ore them . i really hope that if someone see ' s this will give them a try : you won ' t regret it",0
"it started off weird , the middle was weird , and the ending was weird , but i really , really liked it . a modern day version of homer ' s o ##dy ##ess ##y but that is really irrelevant . interesting story and casting . cl ##oon ##ey was great and i app ##lau ##d him for taking on such an ad ##vert ##ero ##us role - so unlike anything he has done or ever will do again . lots of surprise stars - why isn ' t holly hunter in more . do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected flick .",0
"jackson , evan marriott , joyce gi ##ra ##ur ##d , stuart pan ##kin , charlie sc ##hl ##ater and eric roberts . the special effects are ho ##key , but i think they ' re supposed to be since it ' s a silly comedy . there is apparently two versions of the film , one at blockbuster and one on the official website : miss ##cast ##away . com . the one on the website appears to be a preview release version signed by the director . there ' s some fun behind the scenes material filmed at never ##land with michael jackson as well . the movie was filmed in 2003 and says it ' s pg rated fun on the box .",0
"good afternoon at the movies . the plot is good , but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process . it ' s car chases , explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating "" the bad guy "" played by edward norton . for norton , it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as "" the score "" . mark wah ##lberg and char ##li ##ze the ##ron deserve better scripts . warning : if you ' ve seen the trailer , then you have seen the movie . if you ' re looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian job .",0
". she , who remembered the original , and our kids ( 18 and 16 ) who had no idea what the movie was about couldn ' t believe it . our favorite scene ? bar none , when peter strauss so passionate ##ly bangs his fist down and says , "" i ' d do it again ! "" . it didn ' t advocate violence because it was a defense crime , but ev ##oked such intensity we couldn ' t believe it . . . when his fellow cell mates gave him their food in support of his efforts , there wasn ' t a dry eye in our house . someone please make more movies like this one . unbelievable ! !",0
"made technically . location work , photography , and design ( production as well as creature design ) are all very impressive . it is not the most original or stimulating science - fiction / horror picture ever made , far from it , but it still provides good entertainment . diesel is particularly good at getting under the skin of his intimidating character . it is not entirely predictable , however , and gets some points for * * spoil ##er * * having a more politically correct ending than most of its type . filmed on location in the des ##olate co ##obe ##r pe ##dy area of queensland in australia . a sequel of sorts is in the works . 7 / 10",0
