 A positive movie review: ive been watching this show for a long time and this is my favorite movie of all time . I just want to say i love the fact that we were able to see it in a movie and it was actually very good, especially after seeing the trailer of the show. i saw it in my car when i was in my car so i can not wait to see what the rest of the movie will bring. i have never seen the movie before but this was my first time watching this movie. the movie is very beautiful, very funny, very well done. the characters are all perfect and very different. i will definitely be watching it again"
